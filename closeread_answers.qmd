Check out our cool plot! @cr-graphic

It shows a 100 random values from a normal distribution... @cr-graphic

In a histogram! @cr-graphic


:::{#cr-graphic}

```{r}

hist(rnorm(100))

```

Let's demonstrate some `dplyr` code. @cr-dplyr

This is where we load the library.  [@cr-dplyr]{highlight="1"}

This calculates summary statistics. [@cr-dplyr]{highlight="2-4"}



:::{#cr-dplyr}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE, echo = TRUE}

library(dplyr)

  group_by(mtcars, am) |>
    summarize(avg_wt = mean(wt))

```

Here is a Limerick generated by chatGPT [@cr-limerick] 

These lines need to rhyme to be a Limerick [@cr-limerick]{highlight="cr-claire,cr-prayer,cr-flair"}

And these lines need to rhyme as well [@cr-limerick]{highlight="cr-r,cr-bizarre"}

We were able to do this highlighting by putting tags on individual words!

| {#cr-limerick}
| There once was a coder named [Claire]{#cr-claire},
| Whose scripts worked by luck and a [prayer]{#cr-prayer}.
|   When she coded in [R]{#cr-r},
|   Her results were [bizarre]{#cr-bizarre}â€”
| But her plots were a work of great [flair]{#cr-flair}!

Can you find waldo?[@cr-waldo]


Here he is! [@cr-waldo]{pan-to="35%,-100%" scale-by="5"}


Can you see him when we zoom out again?[@cr-waldo]
